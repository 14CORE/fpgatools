Design Principles

- small independent command line utilities, no GUI
- plain C, no C++
- simple Makefiles
- text-based file formats
- no documentation - please read the sources
- automatic test suite

Libraries

(most is to-be-done)
- libfpga-model      memory-only representation of an FPGA
- libfpga-bits       reads and writes .bit bitstream files
- libfpga-floorplan  reads and writes .fp floorplan files
- libfpga-control    programmatic access to libfpga-model
- libfpga-design     larger design elements on top of libfpga-control
- libfpga-test       test harness for libfpga-model and libfpga-control

Design Utilities

- new_fp             creates empty .fp floorplan file
- fp2bit             converts .fp floorplan into .bit bitstream
- bit2fp             converts .bit bitstream into .fp floorplan
- draw_svg_tiles     draws a simple .svg showing tile types

fpgatools Development Utilities

- autotest           executes test suite
- bit2txt            dumps .bit bitstream as text
- hstrrep            high-speed hashed array based search and replace util
- sort_seq           sorts line-based text file by sequence numbers in strings
- merge_seq          merges a pre-sorted text file into wire sequences
- pair2net           reads the first two words per line and builds nets
