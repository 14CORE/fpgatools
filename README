Design Principles

- small independent command line utilities, no GUI
- plain C, no C++
- simple Makefiles
- text-based file formats
- no documentation - read the sources
- automatic test suite

Utilities

- new_fp         creates empty .fp floorplan file
- draw_svg_tiles draws a simple .svg showing tile types
- fp2bit         converts .fp floorplan into .bit bitstream
- bit2txt        dumps .bit bitstream as text
- hstrrep        high-speed hashed array based search and replace util
- sort_seq       sorts line-based text file by sequence numbers in strings
- merge_seq      merges a pre-sorted text file into wire sequences
